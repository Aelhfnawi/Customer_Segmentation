📊 Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering
This project applies unsupervised machine learning techniques to segment customers based on their annual income and spending score, using the popular Mall Customer Segmentation dataset from Kaggle.

🧠 Objective
Cluster customers into distinct groups to help businesses target marketing campaigns more effectively and understand customer behavior based on purchasing power and spending habits.
